# dutch rent limits evaluated
To get an idea of what affects dutch goverment limits on rent


Example outcome: Varying energylabel, resulting in point difference. 
This again resulted in raw-rent limit differences, which are apparently linearly related to points. 

Note that rent limits here are affected by much more than energylabel! It was just the parameter that was varied to obtain this dataset.
